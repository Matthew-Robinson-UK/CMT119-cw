                Computational Thinking is a phrase, first used in the 1980’s by mathematician and computer scientist Seymour Papert (Papert 1980). The definition has changed slightly over the years and was re-defined by Jeanette Wing first in (Wing 2006) and again by (Cuny et al. 2010). Wing defines Computational Thinking as “the mental activity in formulating a problem to admit a computational solution. The solution can be carried out by a human or machine, or more generally, by combinations of humans and machines”. Both in (Wing 2006) and in (Cuny et al. 2010) Wing made clear that computational thinking is a process not limited to computing and that it can be applied in all situations requiring a problem solving approach to find a solution.
