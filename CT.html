                Computational Thinking is a phrase, first used in the 1980’s by mathematician and computer scientist Seymour Papert (1980). The definition has changed slightly over the years and was re-defined by Jeanette Wing first in 2006 and again by Cuny,Snyder,Wing in 2010. Wing defines Computational Thinking as “the mental activity in formulating a problem to admit a computational solution. The solution can be carried out by a human or machine, or more generally, by combinations of humans and machines”. Both in 2006 and in 2010 Wing made clear that computational thinking is a process not limited to computing and that it can be applied in all situations requiring a problem solving approach to find a solution.

                To understand further lets look at the four main areas of computational thinking and apply them to the task of creating a website.
