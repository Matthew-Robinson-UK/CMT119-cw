            Abstraction is thought to be the most important aspect of computational thinking as it allows the use of scaling to deal with increasing complexity (Cuny et al. 2010).
            Abstraction takes the information gained from the previous two steps and removes the non-relevant information to help see the problem more clearly. The real power of abstraction however, comes when we apply a process called generalization. This involves taking that abstracted information and producing generalized solutions that can work on multiple problems. This is where the power of scaling comes in and allows complex problems to be more easily tackled. An example of abstraction would be the periodic table, which takes the chemical information and arranges it into elements grouped by similar properties.

            It is common for a consistent header or footer to be present across a website and by grouping them into a header tag and styling specifically for the tag we can create a solution which works across all pages of our website.
