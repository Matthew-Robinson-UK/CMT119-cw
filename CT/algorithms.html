            Algorithms allow a step-by-step approach to solving the problems. Algorithms can take many forms and are commonly used by computers to execute a function through a series of programmed steps. A more everyday example of algorithms would be following the recipe when baking a cake.

            Using that idea, algorithms can create a clearer and more effective way to approach a problem, an example of which is using an algorithm to better understand how a user would navigate through our website.
