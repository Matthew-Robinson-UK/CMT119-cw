                Decomposition is the process by which we can break a complex task down into smaller sub tasks or problems, reducing  its complexity. A nice example of decomposition would be creating a grocery list for the different ingredients in a meal (McVeigh-Murphy 2019).

            <p>
                For our website we can take a multi-page website, break it down into individual pages and then further to individual sections within each page, creating clearer and more manageable tasks.
