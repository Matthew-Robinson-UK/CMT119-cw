            Computational thinking allows for a much clearer understanding of complex problems (Wing 2006). I have already found great benefit in implementing it to assist in creating a website and believe the ability to persevere through unfamiliar, complex and multi layered problems will continue to be of benefit. Through my continued learning on this course I will also be able to increase my programming skills to support my use of computational thinking, improving the effectiveness of each of the steps involved by working even more collaboratively with computers. Through further research it is clear that computational thinking is highly effective in all areas of problem solving and though I have implemented some elements prior to this course, the ability to approach problems in a structured and reasoned way will be very impactful, something I have already seen when applying these skills to CV writing and approaching a job interview.
