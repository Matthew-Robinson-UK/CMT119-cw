        As stated earlier Jeanette Wing is one of the key influences in the current understanding of computational thinking. She is the Vice president of research at Columbia University, focusing her main area of research on Trustworthy AI. Her research and publications on computational thinking have brought forward a greater understanding of how computer systems can be used to tackle problem solving outside the area of computing (The Data Science Institute at Columbia University 2021).

        Wing spent much of her earlier research on formal methods, a methodology involving mathematical modeling to develop software and hardware systems. She is still an advocate for their use and continues to explore the different applications and uses they can serve (Wing 1990).
        One such area is in the development of trustworthy computing. In 2002 Bill Gates spoke on the topic of trustworthy computing, sending an email to all employees to introduce the new initiative (Charney 2014).

        Trustworthy computing refers to the inherent security, reliability, availability and integrity of a computer system. Jeanette Wing joined Microsoft as the vice president, head of Microsoft research international (Clayton 2012) and was in that role until 2017 when she took on her role at Columbia University. Two other overlapping areas Wing has been involved in researching, are security and privacy. In particular network security and the increasing demand for robust and autonomous network defenses. Finding efficient and scalable approaches to solving the problem of attack graphs is somewhere computational thinking clearly played an important role (Sheyner et al. 2002).

        Throughout researching Jeanette Wingâ€™s work it is clear that she has not only advocates the use of computational thinking in broader problem solving but also practices it in her own work. The bringing together of previous research areas such as formal methods, trustworthy computing, security and privacy to tackle the incredibly complex problem of trustworthy AI is a great example of computational thinking at work (Wing 2021).
