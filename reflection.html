        This module was a great start to my MSc in computing as it has laid the foundation for how to critically think through problems not only specific to computing but also in any area requiring a problem solving approach.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through learning further about computational thinking I have gained a better understanding of how to break down complex problems and approach them systematically and efficiently, something that will be of great benefit going forward through this course. 
        It can be difficult not to rush straight into solving a problem, but so far I have noticed that not only does that lead to worse solutions it also doesn’t save time in the long run. Spending more time in the planning and preparation of a solution will lead to more creative and refined problem solving. Time is almost always a factor when dealing with a problem and planning out a solution through a set of pre-defined steps helps to eliminate bottlenecks and streamline the problem solving process.

        One area I didn’t touch on in the Computational thinking guide is the process of evaluating and reviewing a solution. This is something which when paired with the other steps listed is highly effective in understanding how to continually improve and produce more efficient and capable solutions. I am continuing to work on how to best utilise abstraction and algorithms. Algorithms are something that while I have used them previously, I have never thought through them in quite the same way as I am doing after studying this module. Flowcharts and psuedocode were both unfamiliar previously and finding new ways of using them and producing a clear set of instructions is challenging but also rewarding when going back and evaluating a solution. The process of scaling solutions through generalization is very exciting and something that I have already seen huge benefits in doing. I have been able to see just how impactful that will be in later areas of the course through the process of this assessment. For example when solving problems after abstraction it would be possible to identify similarities between module assignments and work to create solutions we could be adapted and reapplied in mulitple areas. Designing a website with repeatable elements and an overall theme really demonstrated this to me and going forward I plan on building on this skill to come up with creative solutions to problems that take in a larger view than the specific problem they solve.
    </p>
    <p>
        Problem solving is an area I always believed I was very capable in but it has been humbling to take on a new view of how to approach problems and come up with better solutions because of it. As my studying of programming and problem solving skills improve I look forward to bringing them together more to continually find ever more efficient and adaptable solutions to complex problems.
